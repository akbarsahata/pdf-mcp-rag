# Judgements: MinerU Output Variants

This document assesses the two generated mini-papers where the suffix indicates which MinerU extraction variant the pipeline used.

## from-json.md

- **Readability: A** — Clear IEEE-like structure (Title → Abstract → Index Terms → numbered sections). Headings are consistent and the argument is easy to scan.
- **Content quality: B** — Strong high-level synthesis and reasonable framing of the space (supervised NLP, clustering, LLM benchmarks, feedback systems). Citations are relevant, but a few sections (especially clustering) stay somewhat general and could be anchored more tightly to specific cited details.
- **Fluency: A** — Smooth sentence-level writing with consistent terminology and natural transitions.

## from-markdown.md

- **Readability: B** — Overall well organized, but formatting is slightly less “IEEE-like” (mixed heading levels and a minor abstract formatting artifact), which reduces polish.
- **Content quality: B** — Covers the same core ideas with solid claims, but the narrative separation between diagnosis/benchmarking and feedback-oriented systems is a bit less crisp.
- **Fluency: B** — Mostly fluent, but minor style/format artifacts make it feel less finished than the JSON-based version.
